**Short description of survival**
####Basic rules for a Copenhagen survival####
These rules often include more weather-focused rules than human-focused rules. But still, some basics have to be remembered:
<ol>
<li>mind the bikes - it's more probable to get run over by a bike than a car</li>
<li>get a bike - your own bike will is the fastest way to deal with the distances</li>
<li>mind the weather - your iPhone weather forcast says it will be sunny. Think again and be prepared with a good raincoat. Weather in Copenhagen is sometimes frivolous</li>
<li>get a camera - more than often, there's a view worth taking a photo of</li>
  </ol>


####Basic rules for a Copenhagen night survival####
The same, but in the dark, but just put some lights on your bike while riding it.
We need a photo of the city - one by day and one by night.

####Swimming in the canals####
It's a splendid way to break the hot summer days in two. Yeah, it's a Scandinavian country but they still have summer. So, swimming in the canals is a way of give your respects to the local ritches. It's not just a regular canal like in Venice. The water is clear and very often, one can see the bottom of the canal.
